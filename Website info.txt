Lately I find myself asking alot of question: "Who am I? Why am I doing this?". Thats a really loaded question considering I have been on this earth for close to 24 years, and I don't know who exactly
I am or what I am doing. I feel like this is the right time to do this, ask these provocating questions because I'll get to figure out myself before its really late. One reason 
I can think of as to why I wasn't asking these questions earlier is I did not want to change. I liked myself where I was. Scared, proud, inconsiderate, impateint. I was comfortable
with who I was and what I was doing. But now I realise my dark side is overshadowing my good side and this had a profound effect on how I view things in life. My friends kept 
telling me I am a pessimist, always seeing the bad side of things without thinking about how just right things will turn out. I knew they were right but I didn't want to change.
I was comfortable. By asking myself questions, I hope I can make myself accountable and change my personality. One thing I know for sure is that my future self will thank my past
self as my present self currently wonders and ponders on how to center a div.
